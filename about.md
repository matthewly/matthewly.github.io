Hi! I'm a Software Engineer at Workday. I currently work on Prism Analytics, an end-to-end data analytics product, part of the Workday ecosystem, which helps businesses better understand their financials and HR data. Being a part of Data Discovery team in Analytics org, I specialize in UI development and integrating the product with other services within Workday. On my free time, I enjoy tinkering with web development, especially thinking of ways to consume external free-tier APIs to improve web apps. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
