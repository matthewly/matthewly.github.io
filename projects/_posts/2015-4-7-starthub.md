NodeJS web application that provides users with a means to find collaborators for their own startup ideas. StartHub has an interface that allows users to post project ideas that other members can join and to search people by skill, interest, or location. StartHub also allows users to discover, join, or share projects other members are posting. StartHub gives project ideas the opportunity to scale into startups and eventually full fledged companies.
