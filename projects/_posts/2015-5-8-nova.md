title: Social Network Visual Analysis
---

Nova is a software platform for visualizing connections and performing graph analysis on a cluster of people. It generates directional graphs between people based on the strength of their connections/network. The strength of their connections is measured by the frequency of interaction and a sentiment value provided by the Muse headbands during communications coupled with a machine learning engine. We then use these relationship strengths to see healthiest relationships between friend circles, strongest/weakest chains in a network, and deploy dijkstra's algorithm to plot out the most efficient chain of connections to introduce person A to person B.
