title: Fetch data externally from API in ReactJS
---
- React only renders components based on props and state
- To get external data into your web app, you need to fetch that data and store into props/state
- axios HTTP library to make request to external API
  - axios.get(...) chained by .then() to parsee response
- componentDidMount life cycle method = after elements are added to DOM
- 

See my example here:
