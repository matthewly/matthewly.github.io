title: Toggling in Single-line Codebase
---

Toggles are development mechanisms to keep code turned off until they are complete and ready for general uptake. Development-wise all of your code changes should have an ON and OFF path, controlled by a toggle switch. When your features are ready for (internal / sandbox / production) environments, the toggle's confidence level can change accordingly. This is crucial for continuous deployment and to support single code line.
